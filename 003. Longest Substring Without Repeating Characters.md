## 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/description/

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.


#### Example:
```
Given "abcabcbb", the answer is "abc", which the length is 3.

Given "bbbbb", the answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Given "pwwkew", the answer is "wke", with the length of 3. Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

#### My Solution:
##### 1. 简单直接版 Time: O(n),  Space: O(1)

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s):
        """
        :type s: str
        :rtype: int
        """
        start = 0
        max_l = 0

        for pts in range(1, len(s)):
            if(s[pts] in s[start:pts]):
                max_l = len(s[start:pts]) if (len(s[start:pts]) > max_l) else max_l
                start = s[start:pts].index(s[pts]) + 1 + start
            else:
                if(pts == len(s) - 1):
                    max_l = max([max_l, len(s[start:])])

        return max_l if(max_l != 0) else len(s)
```
