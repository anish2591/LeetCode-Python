## 27. Remove Element

https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-element/description/

Given an array and a value, remove all instances of that value in-place and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

The order of elements can be changed. It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the new length.

#### Example:
```
Given nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3,

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2.
```

#### My Solution:

简单粗暴，使用python的delete直接解

```python
class Solution:
    def removeElement(self, nums, val):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type val: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        for i in range(len(nums)-1,-1,-1):
            if(nums[i] == val):
                del nums[i]

        return len(nums)
```
